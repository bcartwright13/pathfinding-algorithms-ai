PA1 Part 1 by Brandon Cartwright, Johnatan Garcia, Dario Vasquez

Brandon Cartwright:

Contributed to loop structures in node traversal.
Managed node creation and pathfinding logic.
Collaborated in debugging sessions.

Dario Vasquez:

Integrated file reading functionalities.
Chose appropriate data structures (deque, sets).
Assisted in refining code documentation and outputs.

Johnatan Garcia:

Led initial design of BFS algorithm.
Managed edge case handling for grid boundaries.
Led testing with various test cases.


For part 1 of this assignment, we have only implemented BFS by using a node class and some helper methods to aid with reading the test files and printing out relevant information. This code is written in Python.

To run this, you can use a standard "python3 PA1Part1V2.py" command. Once running, the program will ask which test file you would like to run i.e. "Test1.txt".
