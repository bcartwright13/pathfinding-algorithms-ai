# PA1 Part 1

For part 1 of this assignment, we have only implemented BFS by using a node class and some helper methods to aid with reading the test files and printing out relevant information. This code is written in Python.

To run this, you can use a standard "python3 PA1Part1V2.py" command. Once running, the program will ask which test file you would like to run i.e. "Test1.txt".
